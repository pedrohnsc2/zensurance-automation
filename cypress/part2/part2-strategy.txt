In this txt i'll describe more about the test strategy used in the API testing

Test Scenario 1: API Response Validation

Acceptance Criteria:

-Verify that the API endpoint is accessible and returns a success status code (200).
-Verify that the API returns the expected data format and content.
-Verify that the API response time is within the acceptable limit (e.g., under 2 seconds).

Test Scenario 2: Security Validation

Acceptance Criteria:

-Verify that the API endpoint uses secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
-Verify that the API endpoint requires authentication (e.g., API key or token-based authentication).
-Verify that the API endpoint implements proper rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks.
-Verify that the API endpoint implements proper input validation to prevent malicious attacks (e.g., SQL injection).

Test Scenario 3: Task Automation Validation

Acceptance Criteria:

-Verify that tasks can be created, updated, and deleted through the API.
-Verify that the API can retrieve task details, including task status and completion date.
-Verify that the API can assign tasks to specific users and retrieve user information.
