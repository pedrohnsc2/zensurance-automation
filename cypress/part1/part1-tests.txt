This txt is to demonstrate the unit test cases the provided code in part 1 should be done

1 - Test the functionality of Price class:

Test that the Price class is able to initialize the price data correctly
Test that the fee and premium values are set correctly for a Price instance
Test that the industry value is set correctly for a Price instance

2 - Test the functionality of User class:

Test that the User class is able to initialize the UserData correctly
Test that the getQuestionBank() method returns the correct IQuestionBank instance
Test that the isBroker() method returns the correct value (true or false)
Test that the isUser() method returns the correct value (true or false)

3 - Test the functionality of PriceEngine class:

Test that the getPossiblePrices() method returns the correct prices from the priceBank
Test that the userQualifies() method returns the correct value (true or false) based on the user's answers to the question bank
Test that the getLowestAndHighestPrices() method returns the correct values for lowestPrice and highestPrice
Test that the getPriceForUser() method returns the correct UserPriceResult instance
Test that the getPrice() method returns the correct UserPriceResult instance for a User and the correct BrokerPriceResult instance for a Broker.

4 - Test the functionality of UserPriceResult and BrokerPriceResult:

Test that the UserPriceResult is correctly set with the correct values (lowestPrice and highestPrice or NO_PRICE)
Test that the BrokerPriceResult is correctly set with the correct values (possiblePrices, lowestPrice, and highestPrice or NO_PRICE)

Edge Case scenarios for those scenarios

1 - Test the behavior when there is no price in the price bank:
Input: an instance of PriceEngine with an empty price bank
Output: a UserPriceResult with a MissingPrice object with the description "No price selected"

2 - Test the behavior when a user doesn't agree with the terms and conditions:
Input: an instance of User with the agreesWithTermsAndConds property in the questionBank set to "no"
Output: a UserPriceResult with a MissingPrice object with the description "No price selected"

3 - Test the behavior when a user doesn't specify their agreement with the terms and conditions:
Input: an instance of User without the agreesWithTermsAndConds property in the questionBank
Output: a UserPriceResult with a LowestAndHighestPrices object with the calculated values for the lowest and highest prices

4 - Test the behavior when a broker makes a request:
Input: an instance of User with the role property set to "broker"
Output: a BrokerPriceResult with a list of all the prices in the price bank and a LowestAndHighestPrices object with the calculated values for the lowest and highest prices

5 - Test the behavior when a user with an industry outside of "legal" or "food" makes a request:
Input: an instance of Price with an industry other than "legal" or "food"
Output: a UserPriceResult with a MissingPrice object with the description "No price selected"

6 - Test the behavior when a user requests prices for an industry outside of "legal" or "food":
Input: an instance of User with a questionBank that has an industry other than "legal" or "food"
Output: a UserPriceResult with a MissingPrice object with the description "No price selected"
